> PS: The name is temporary. We are interested in getting an interesting name :tada:

## Goals
*  integrate the landing page with the "catalog", the docs, and other key elements
* Create the generator in minimal HTML / Vanilla JS / CSS so anyone in future can edit them / modify them without having much expertise
* make it easy to translate (currently we are using Weblate with is cool for apps but less ideal for large web pages)
* must be able to consume the existing JSON feed
* make it super easy to edit

## Constraints
* must be possible to be hosted on github pages, gitlab pages or any other static site hosting.
