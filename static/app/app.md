# Get {{ appimage.title }} now!</h1>
## Usage</h2>
{{ appimage.title }} is available as an AppImage which means "one
app = one file", which you can download and run on your Linux system
while you don't need a package manager and nothing gets changed in
your system. Awesome!

AppImages are single-file applications that run on most
Linux distributions. Download an application, make it executable,
and run! No need to install. No system libraries or system
preferences are altered. Most AppImages run on recent versions of
Arch Linux, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, Red Hat, Ubuntu, and
other common desktop distributions.

### Running {{ appimage.title }} on Linux without installation</h3>
Unlike other applications, AppImages do not need to be installed
before they can be used. However, they need to be marked as
executable before they can be run. This is a Linux
security feature.

Behold! AppImages are usually not verified by others.
Follow these instructions only if you trust the developer
of the software. Use at your own risk!</p>
